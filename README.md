# TrumpTracker
This is a simple Alexa skill to recall Trump's latest tweet as well as how many people favorited or retweeted that tweet. This is not an endorsement or sign of support for Trump.

## Setup
You need an OAuth 2 Bearer Token for the Twitter API to run this lambda function. See more [here](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/reference/post/oauth2/token).

You need a `config.py` file with your Alexa skill app ID. See `config_example.py` for an example.

## Phrases
These are example Alexa phrases I used in the skill.
- "Alexa, ask Trump Tracker what's up?"
- "Alexa, ask Trump Tracker what did Trump say?"
- "Alexa, ask Trump Tracker how many people favorited Trump's latest tweet?"
- "Alexa, ask Trump Tracker how many people retweeted Trump's latest tweet?"
